## 6. **Secure Coding / Developer & Technical Training**

This is for your tech audience: developers, DevOps, architects.

**Hero / Headline**

* Headline: *“Build Security Into Code — Developer Training That Matters”*
* Subheader: *“Hands-on, practical secure coding and DevSecOps training for dev teams.”*

**Why Developer-Specific Training**

* Developers face unique threats: injection, insecure APIs, secrets in code, insecure dependencies.
* Security must shift left — embedding security in design/SDLC.
* Many breaches are due to poor code, not lack of perimeter.

**Core Topics / Modules**

* Secure Coding Fundamentals (OWASP Top 10, input validation, output encoding)
* Authentication & Authorization best practices
* Secrets management & encryption
* Secure API design & input sanitization
* Secure dependency / third-party library management
* DevSecOps / CI/CD pipeline security
* Threat modeling & adversary thinking
* Static / dynamic code analysis, fuzzing, SAST/DAST
* Secure design patterns & secure architecture

**Delivery Styles / Formats**

* Instructor-led workshops (virtual or in-person)
* Live coding labs / exercises
* Code review simulations
* Pair programming with security coach
* Hands-on capture-the-flag / challenge labs

**Benefits / Outcomes**

* Fewer vulnerabilities in production
* Security integrated into development process
* Developers gain “security mindset”
* Reduced remediation cost & time post-release

**Flow / Process**

1. Pre-assessment: evaluate current dev knowledge & code vulnerabilities
2. Module delivery + lab challenges
3. Code review / guided exercise
4. Post-assessment: check improvement
5. Periodic refreshers

**Case / Story / Example**

* “After training, client reduced critical findings in code scans by 60%.”
* Testimonials

**CTA**

* “Request Secure Dev Demo / Try a Secure Coding Lab”
* “See Developer Training Curriculum”

**FAQ**

* What languages / stacks do you support?
* Do we need to open ports / sandbox environment?
* Can we plug into our codebase (without exposing secrets)?
* How many hours per module / lab?
