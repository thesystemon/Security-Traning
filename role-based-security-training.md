## 2. **Role-Based Training**

This page emphasizes how training should not be “one-size-fits-all,” but tailored to roles (executive, IT, finance, developer, operations, HR). Role-based training enhances relevance and engagement. ([Terranova Security][1])

**Hero / Headline**

* Headline: *“Training That Speaks Their Role — Not a Generic Course”*
* Subheader: *“Security awareness aligned to job functions, so your employees learn what matters to them.”*

**Why Role-Based? (Value Proposition)**

* Attackers tailor phishing/social engineering based on roles (e.g. CFO target, HR data request).
* When training reflects real tasks, learners engage more and retain better.
* Role-based training shows that you care about each team’s challenges.
* Based on adult learning principles: relevance, confidence, satisfaction. ([Terranova Security][1])

**Roles You Cover & Sample Modules**

* **Executives & Leadership**
  • Business email compromise (BEC)

* **Finance / Accounting / Procurement**
  • Invoice fraud, request for payments, fake vendor emails
  • Multi-step verification, payment validation
* **IT / Operations / Admin**
  • Infrastructure attacks, phishing with attachments, lateral movement
  • Patching, network access controls, privilege escalation

* **HR / Legal / Compliance / Customer Support**

  • Data privacy laws, secure record keeping

**How It Works (Path Design)**

* Onboarding path: all employees get basic modules + role-specific modules.
* Role-based branching: after core awareness, employees only receive modules relevant to their role.
* Dynamic content: you can add modules or update per role based on new threats.
* Assessments: you can include quizzes and scenario-based tests relevant to each function.

**Benefits & Impact**

* Better retention and relevance
* Fewer false positives / less frustration (learners don’t see irrelevant content)
* Stronger mitigation in high-risk departments
* Easier to defend / demonstrate compliance (you can show “Finance folks did invoice-fraud training”)

**Use Case / Story**

* Example: “After introducing role-based modules for Finance, client XYZ saw a 70% drop in invoice fraud clicks in 3 months.”
* Testimonials from different role users

**CTA**
