### **7. Purple Team Workshops**

**Hero / Headline**

* Headline: “Bridge the Gap — Purple Teaming for Real Security”
* Subheader: “Collaborative Red vs Blue team exercises to sharpen both offense and defense.”

**Why Purple Teaming**

* Traditional Red vs Blue can be siloed. Purple combines strengths.
* Attackers evolve faster than defenses — Purple Team closes the loop.
* Enables defenders to see real adversary techniques in action.
* Faster detection, faster response, continuous improvement.

**Core Topics / Modules**

* Mapping ATT&CK Tactics & Techniques to defenses
* Live attack simulation with defenders watching in real time
* Detection engineering: building alerts & SIEM rules
* Threat hunting guided by live adversary behavior
* Hands-on collaboration between Red & Blue
* Reporting and improving defensive coverage

**Delivery Styles / Formats**

* Facilitated purple team workshops (onsite/virtual)
* Real-time attack-defense simulation labs
* Threat emulation based on MITRE ATT&CK
* Custom scenarios mapped to your environment
* Guided defensive rule-building

**Benefits / Outcomes**

* Stronger detection & response capabilities
* Blue team learns how attackers think; Red team learns defense realities
* Improved SOC efficiency with fewer blind spots
* Measurable uplift in security maturity

**Flow / Process**

1. Pre-workshop planning: choose adversary scenarios
2. Red Team executes live techniques
3. Blue Team monitors/detects/responds
4. Joint review: what worked, what failed
5. Build new detections together
6. Post-workshop reporting & metrics

**Case / Story / Example**
“After a Purple Team workshop, a client identified 12 detection gaps and built alerts, reducing mean time-to-detect by 40%.”

**Testimonials**

> “Best workshop we’ve done. Our SOC finally understood how attackers really behave.”
