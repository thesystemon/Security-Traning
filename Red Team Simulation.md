**Hero / Headline**

* Headline: “Think Like Hackers — Test Like Hackers”
* Subheader: “Full-scope adversary emulation to test your people, processes, and technology.”

**Why Red Teaming**

* Traditional penetration tests only scratch the surface.
* Red Teams emulate advanced persistent threats (APTs).
* Helps identify true business risk, not just technical flaws.
* Validates detection, response, and organizational resilience.

**Core Topics / Modules**

* Recon & OSINT collection on organization
* Initial access (phishing, misconfigurations, exposed services)
* Privilege escalation & lateral movement
* Persistence & stealth techniques
* Data exfiltration & impact simulation
* Executive debrief & remediation roadmap

**Delivery Styles / Formats**

* Multi-week Red Team engagement
* Black-box / gray-box testing
* APT-style campaigns (tailored to your industry threats)
* Social engineering exercises
* Covert simulations without tipping off Blue team

**Benefits / Outcomes**

* Real-world view of organizational resilience
* Test defenses against nation-state level tactics
* Identify weak points in detection & response
* Improve executive awareness of cyber risks

**Flow / Process**

1. Planning & scoping (define crown jewels)
2. Red Team execution (stealth operations)
3. Capture of objectives (data, access, persistence)
4. Debrief with leadership
5. Defensive gap analysis & recommendations

**Case / Story / Example**
“One client’s Red Team simulation exposed a privilege escalation path from a single phishing email to full domain admin — all undetected by their SOC.”

**Testimonials**
