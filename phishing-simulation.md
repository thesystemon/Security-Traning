## 3. **Phishing Simulation & Social Engineering**

This is one of the most compelling modules because people like to *test* rather than just read theory.

**Hero / Headline**

* Headline: *“Test Their Readiness — Simulated Phishing That Teaches, Not Punishes”*
* Subheader: *“We run safe, realistic phishing and social engineering simulations — then turn mistakes into learning opportunities.”*

**Problem / Pain**

* Many employees still click on phishing links (even seasoned ones).
* Theoretical training without testing isn’t enough.
* Real attacks evolve; your simulation must mimic real threats.

**What You Provide / How It Works**

* Mock phishing campaigns (email, SMS, USB, voice / vishing)
* Realistic lures (based on your industry, employee roles, seasonal events)
* Multi-stage scenarios (e.g. click → login page → fake credentials prompt)
* “Teachable moment” landing pages: when a user fails a simulation, they are redirected to a mini-lesson explaining what went wrong. (This is used by vendors like Proofpoint) ([Proofpoint][2])
* Follow-up training / remediation for those who fall for “lures.”
* Metrics: click rate, report rate, dwell time (how long until report), repeat failure tracking.

**Sample Simulation Types**

* Standard phishing (email with malicious link/attachment)
* Spear phishing / impersonation attempts
* SMS / SMS phishing (smishing)
* Voice / Vishing (phone calls)
* USB drop / physical bait
* Whaling (targeted attacks on executives)

**Benefits / Outcomes**

* Reveal your organization’s weakest points
* Instant feedback helps behavior change
* Data-driven insights allow targeted re-training
* Improves reporting habits (“See it, report it”)
* Measurable risk reduction over time

**Process / Flow**

1. Define campaign targets and goals
2. Design lures / phishing templates (you can customize branding)
3. Launch campaign
4. Track who clicked, who reported, how fast
5. Provide immediate feedback / mini-lesson
6. Remediate & re-run for those who failed
7. Periodic retesting & trend tracking

**Success Metrics**

* Phish-click % (clicks / attempts)
* Report rate (% who reported)
* Dwell time / time-to-report
* Improvement over successive rounds

**Customer Example / Story**

* “In a 500-user simulation, 25% clicked the lure initially. After two rounds + training, that dropped to 4%.”
* Testimonial from client

**CTA**

* “Run a Free Phishing Test on Your Team”
* “See Sample Campaign Templates”
* “Get Phishing Simulation Quote”

**FAQ / Objections**

* Does simulation embarrass employees? (We present it as a safe learning tool)
* Can we control who is tested / exempt certain users?
* How often do you simulate?
* Do you provide custom vs generic lures?
* Can simulation be synchronized with training modules?
