# üìò **Chapter 11: Secure Coding Training for Developers**

---


### 1. **Objective**

Secure coding training equips developers with the **knowledge and hands-on skills** to write applications that are **resilient against cyberattacks**.
Since **70% of security issues arise from insecure code**, developers must learn to recognize and avoid common coding mistakes.

Goals:

* Teach developers to **understand attacker mindset**.
* Cover **OWASP Top 10, SANS Top 25** vulnerabilities in coding practices.
* Provide **real-world secure coding patterns & anti-patterns**.
* Shift security left ‚Äì **build security at design & coding stage** instead of fixing later.
* Empower developers to perform **self-security testing** before releasing software.

---

### 2. **Topics Covered**

#### **A. Secure Coding Fundamentals**

* Principle of Least Privilege (POLP).
* Input Validation & Output Encoding.
* Secure Error & Exception Handling.
* Secure Authentication & Password Storage.
* Secure Session Management.

#### **B. OWASP Top 10 Training**

* **Injection Attacks (SQLi, NoSQLi, Command Injection).**
* **Broken Authentication & Session Management.**
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).**
* **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR).**
* **Security Misconfiguration.**
* **Sensitive Data Exposure.**
* **Broken Access Control.**
* **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).**
* **Insecure Deserialization.**
* **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring.**

#### **C. Secure Coding by Language/Stack**

* **Java & Spring Boot** ‚Äì Avoiding insecure deserialization, JDBC injection.
* **.NET / C#** ‚Äì Secure input validation, config hardening.
* **Python** ‚Äì Avoiding pickle deserialization, dependency risks.
* **JavaScript / Node.js / React** ‚Äì Avoiding XSS, sanitizing input.
* **Mobile Apps (Android/iOS)** ‚Äì Secure storage & API calls.

#### **D. Secure Design Patterns**

* Use of **prepared statements & parameterized queries**.
* Strong **password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2)**.
* **Token-based authentication (JWT, OAuth2)**.
* **Rate limiting** to prevent brute force.
* **Code review checklists for security**.

---

### 3. **Delivery Methods**

* **Instructor-Led Workshops** ‚Äì 2‚Äì5 days, hands-on secure coding labs.
* **E-Learning Modules** ‚Äì Bite-sized coding vulnerability lessons.
* **Hackathon Style Training** ‚Äì Gamified secure coding competitions.
* **Code Review Simulations** ‚Äì Practice reviewing & fixing insecure code.
* **Integration with DevOps Pipelines** ‚Äì Security training embedded in CI/CD.

---

### 4. **Exercises**

Practical labs ensure **learn-by-doing** approach:

* **Exercise 1 (SQL Injection Fix)**
  Provide insecure login form ‚Üí Devs must fix using parameterized queries.

* **Exercise 2 (XSS Attack)**
  Insecure comment box ‚Üí Devs apply output encoding & sanitization.

* **Exercise 3 (Authentication Security)**
  Weak password storage in plain text ‚Üí Implement bcrypt with salt.

* **Exercise 4 (CSRF Defense)**
  Vulnerable money transfer form ‚Üí Apply CSRF tokens.

* **Exercise 5 (Broken Access Control)**
  Modify URL to access another user‚Äôs account ‚Üí Fix with RBAC.

* **Exercise 6 (Secure Logging)**
  Code logs sensitive data ‚Üí Redact PII & secure logs.

* **Exercise 7 (Dependency Check)**
  Outdated library with CVE ‚Üí Update & run dependency check tool.

---

### 5. **Reporting & Metrics**

To measure effectiveness:

* **Vulnerability Fix Rate** ‚Äì % of insecure code correctly fixed.
* **Secure Coding Assessment Scores** ‚Äì Pre & post-training tests.
* **Code Review Accuracy** ‚Äì Ability to spot vulnerabilities in sample code.
* **Real-World Application Security Findings** ‚Äì Reduction in vulnerabilities after training.
* **Training Completion Rate** ‚Äì % developers who completed program.
* **OWASP Top 10 Coverage Score** ‚Äì Measured through secure coding labs.

---

### 6. **Pricing Guidance**

Secure coding training is **role-based & stack-specific**, so pricing varies:

* **Basic Secure Coding Workshop (1‚Äì2 Days)** ‚Üí \$5,000 ‚Äì \$8,000 (‚Çπ4‚Äì6.5 Lakh).
* **Full OWASP Top 10 Developer Program (5 Days)** ‚Üí \$12,000 ‚Äì \$20,000 (‚Çπ10‚Äì16 Lakh).
* **Enterprise Program (Customized per tech stack, annual)** ‚Üí \$25,000 ‚Äì \$50,000 (‚Çπ20‚Äì40 Lakh).
* **SMB Developer Teams (Online + Labs for 20‚Äì30 devs)** ‚Üí ‚Çπ3‚Äì8 Lakh.

---

### 7. **Delivery Add-Ons**

* **Secure Coding Cheat Sheets** (per language).
* **Custom Code Vulnerability Playbooks** for client‚Äôs tech stack.
* **Gamified Learning Portal** ‚Äì Leaderboards, badges for top devs.
* **Secure Code Review Tool Integration** (SonarQube, Checkmarx, Fortify).
* **CI/CD Pipeline Security Checks** ‚Äì Shift-left security testing.
* **Post-Training Mentorship** ‚Äì Monthly review sessions with dev leads.

---

‚úÖ **Why Clients Invest in This**

* Fixing insecure code **post-production costs 30x more** than fixing at coding stage.
* Regulators (PCI-DSS, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA) require **secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC)**.
* Reduces vulnerabilities found in **penetration tests & bug bounty reports**.
* Builds **developer confidence & productivity**.
* Helps organization **pass compliance audits faster**.
