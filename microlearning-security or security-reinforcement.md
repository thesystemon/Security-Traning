## 4. **Microlearning & Reinforcement**

This page sells the value of short, frequent nudges to keep awareness fresh and avoid “training fatigue.”

**Hero / Headline**

* Headline: *“Learning That Sticks — Micro Lessons, Repeated & Reinforced”*
* Subheader: *“Short, timely reminders and refreshers to keep awareness alive.”*

**Why Microlearning Matters**

* Retention fades quickly — without reinforcement, people forget 70% of what they learn in days.
* Short 1–3 minute modules are more digestible, less intrusive.
* Reinforcement combats “set and forget” training.
* Spaced repetition and nudges help embed habits.

**Formats & Delivery**

* Nano-lessons (1–3 min videos, animations)
* Tip sheets, infographics, posters
* Email reminders / security tips
* In-app notifications / popups (if applicable)
* Quiz blasts / flash questions
* “Security moment” breaks in meetings / team huddles

**Schedule & Cadence**

* Weekly / bi-weekly micro-lessons
* Triggered lessons based on events (e.g. recent breach news, new threat)
* Monthly or quarterly “refresh weeks”

**How It Integrates**

* Tied to the main awareness program
* Reinforcement modules relate to prior training
* Linked to phishing simulation triggers (if someone failed, send extra micro modules)

**Benefits / Outcomes**

* Sustained awareness over time
* Less training fatigue vs long modules
* Increased recall in day-to-day work
* Keeps security “top of mind”
